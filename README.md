Kura-Kura is a simple VPN GUI for the (semi-)automatic script from my other [repository](https://github.com/idrakimuhamad/open-connect-auto-login-script).

It allows you to set the data needed, such as the server address, username, and password, and then connect to the VPN server with a single click. It also provide VPN slice so you can provide list of URLs that will be accessed through the VPN connection.

## Prerequisites

The app requires the following packages to be installed:

All of this can be installed through Homebrew.
